# Fourier Features for Neural Networks

This repository contains an implementation of the paper "Fourier Features let Networks Learn High Frequency Functions in Low Dimensional Domain" using TensorFlow. The implementation demonstrates how to incorporate Fourier features into neural networks to enable them to learn high-frequency functions efficiently in a low-dimensional domain.

## Requirements

Make sure you have the following dependencies installed to run the code:

- TensorFlow 2.x
- TensorFlow Datasets
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- ImageIO
- PyYAML
